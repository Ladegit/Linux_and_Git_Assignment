# You have been hired as a new Data Engineer at CoreDataEngineers. The CoreDataEngineers infrastructure is based on the Linux Operating System. Your manager has tasked you with the responsibility of managing the companyâ€™s data infrastructure and version control tool.
# Task 1
Your manager has assigned you the task of building a Bash script (use only bash scripting) that performs a simple ETL process:
Extract: Download a CSV file. You can access the CSV using this link. Save it into a folder called raw. Your script should confirm that the file has been saved into the raw folder.

Transform: After downloading the file, perform a simple transformation by renaming the column named Variable_code to variable_code. Then, select only the following columns: year, Value, Units, variable_code. Save the content of these selected columns into a file named 2023_year_finance.csv. This file should be saved in a folder called Transformed, your Bash script should confirm that it was loaded into the folder.

Load: Load the transformed data into a directory named Gold. Also, confirm that the file has been saved into the folder.

Note: Use environment variables for the URL, and call it in your script. Write a well-detailed script, add sufficient comments to the script, and print out information for each step.

# Below is the step by step process I followed to execute the task

-I created a bash script with specific commands to execute the Extraction, Transform and Load tasks. 
# Step 1 - Extract
-My first command was to create directories
mkdir -p raw Transformed Gold

-I proceeded to extract the provided file using these commands
echo "Extracting data from $URL..."
curl -o raw/data.csv "$URL"
-I added a command to check if the file was downloaded
if [ -f raw/data.csv ]; then
     echo "File downloaded to raw/ folder."
else
   echo "Failed to download file."
   exit 1
fi
# Step 2 - Transform
-I proceeded to transform the file and load it into Transformed directory with this command
awk -F, 'BEGIN { OFS="," } 
NR==1 { for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) $i=tolower($i) } 
{ print $1, $5, $6, $9 }' raw/data.csv > "Transformed/2023_year_finance.csv"

# Step 3: Load into Gold folder
-I loaded the transformed file from Transformed folder into Gold folder using this command
cp "Transformed/2023_year_finance.csv" Gold/


# Task 2
Your manager has asked you to schedule the script to run daily using cron jobs (research this). Schedule the script to run every day at 12:00 AM.
I used the following command to schedule the script to run daily

ghk
